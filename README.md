# Last but not least
#### *Have fun ⭐* I know this way this pretty hard. I’ll tell you the secret to fighting strong enemies. It’s easy, keep getting up and attack them with your moves continuously.
#### I knew someone who came copy to this repo . Yes, you can but Victory is never decided by program performance alone. Nor by the skill of the programmer, alone. The result itself is the only truth!
